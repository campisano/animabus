# animabus

To obtain a working repository at first time:

- git clone git@github.com:campisano/animabus.git
- cd animabus/animabusws/
- mvn clean install
- mvn tomcat:run

Now you can use your favorite editor to manage the project, with all dependencies already downloaded.

There is a ready Eclipse project, to import using General -> Existing Projects into Workspace and selecting the 'eclipse' subfolder of this project.

You should configure a Tomcat server (>= 7.0) in your Eclipse environment.
